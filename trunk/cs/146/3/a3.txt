                        Assignment #3
                Due Tues. Apr 29 at beginning of class

(10 marks) 1. Write a Bourne shell script called {\tt rename} which
renames a list of files in a systematic way.  It's usage looks like:

    rename 'regexp/replStr' [list-of-files]

"regexp" is a regular expression, and "replStr" is a replacement string.  For
each filename that matches the regular expression, the part of the name that
matches the regular expression is replaced by the replacement string.  eg.,

    $ ls
    foo.c   bar.c   bazar.f
    $ rename 'a/aa' *       # duplicate the first "a" in the filename.
    $ ls
    foo.c   baar.c  baazar.f
    $ rename '\.c$/.f' *.c  # rename all files ending in ".c" to end with ".f"
    $ ls
    foo.f   baar.f   baazar.f

(10  marks) 2.  Project 2 at the end of Chapter 5 in the course text
(Glass + Ables, page 209), except that you don't need addresses, just
names and phone numbers.  The utility should be called "phone", the
database should be stored in your home directory in a file called
"phone.txt", and it should be searchable using any string that appears
in phone.txt.  You add entries as follows:

    $ phone -a "John Smith[tab]949-824-1234"

where [tab] is the tab character.  phone should allow the option "-i",
which means "the search is case insensitive" (by default it should be
case sensitive).

(10 marks) 3.  Project 3 on the same page as above.  The usage should be
as follows:

    zap [-f] [-N] [-c CPU_PERCENT] [-uid USER_ID] [-u USER_NAME] \
	[-t TOTAL_TIME] [-m MEMORY_USAGE]

where anything in brackets is optional.  zap should, by default,
print the output of the "ps" command for the process that it's about
to kill, ask for confirmation, and actually perform the kill only
if the confirmation string starts with Y or y.  If given the "-f"
(force) option, it skips the confirmation; if given the -N option,
it kills with signal N rather than the default.
